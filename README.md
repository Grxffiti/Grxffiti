Hi everybody, Iâ€™m Grxffiti! I use Grxffiti for all accounts and sometimes Gr_ffiti.
I'm a PC hardware nerd and I'm always learning more and more about my passion. I found the hobby in March 2020 and now I have my own custom PC setup and priceless knowledge. I specialize in cases, RGB, and making great PCPartPicker lists. Although I know a substantial amount of all aspects, I am not a master in any relative to many other members in the PC hardware community.
As for software, I know a basic amount of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Computer science is a future endeavor, and I hope to beocome proficient in these languages along with Python.
Any inquiries can go to me on Discord at Grxffiti#0001. I am in many popular PC building servers.
