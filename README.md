PC hardware nerd and I'm always learning more and more about my passion. I found the hobby in March 2020 and now I have my own custom PC setup and priceless knowledge. I specialize in cases, RGB, and making great PCPartPicker lists. Although I know a substantial amount of all aspects, I am not a master in any relative to many other members in the PC hardware community.
